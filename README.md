·       Finetune the Product with high demand and extend the sales to additional regions also.

·       Finetune the most highly generated region and we can locate our Headquater there just to dominate the market and stay close to the customers.

## Post Analysis

**Recommendations and Observations**

**Observations**

•	Australia leads regional sales with $1,137,367.
•	Most performed sales person is Ches Bonnell with generation of revenue worth $320,901. He had his major sales in January although he made sales to all regions but he dominated India the most.
•	Least performed sales person is Wilone O'Kielt with revenue generation worth of $138,523.  He also made sales to all regions but dominated New Zealand where he had his major sales.
•	Most demanded product is 50% Dark Bites with a count 60. Its price range of 2007-4006 dominated and were bought the most. And the least bought was 14007-16006. It was highly purchased in Australia.
•	Least performed product is Choco Coated Almonds with a count of 39.  Even though Ches supplied the largest share with a revenue of $42,854, yet it only had its larger revenue from Canada with a revenue of $57,463.
•	Most supplied region is Australia with the highest revenue worth of $1,137,367 . 50% Dark Bites dominated the region out of other product we supplied and the price range that was highly purchased was 6007-8006.
•	The least Supplied Region is New Zealand with a low revenue worth of $950,418. Mint Chip Choco dominated out of other product we have. Madelene performed the bet in the region but we had the highest demand amount from price range of 7-2006 with June been the most performed month.
•	January is the most active month where we generated the highest revenue with a sum of $896,105. Kaine performed the best in January and UK was the region we recorded the largest revenue. The product that sold highest was Organic Choco Syryp and lots of Boxes was shipped ranging from 1-100 with 49 counts and the range of 101-200 with a top count of 52. The dominant price which we had the largest sales amount was the range of 2007-4006 with a count of 36 and the next was the range of 4007-6006 with a count of 34.
•	April is the month we recorded the lowest revenue generated with a sum of $674,051. Even though Ches top the most performed salesperson for this month, yet the highest price range which the product was sold was 7-2006 with the product Eclairs leading the most sold. USA was the region that performed best in this month.


**Recommendations**

•	Ches should be cospeciated for job well-done just to serve as motivation for others and as an example for others to look up to. Since we have some regions not performing to our expectations, we can transfer him there to implement necessary suiting measures.
•	Wilone can be transferred to meet with Ches to learn how he handles and relate with his customers. He can also be retrenched if the condition stays persistent or there is no improvement on his personal expectations
•	We can make available much more than other product, 50% Dark Bites. Since we realized much revenue from it, we want to remain dominant, consistent and increase revenue. Australia could be set as the headquarter of this product so that our cost price stays low and we also stay close to the customers.
•	Choco Coated Almond's taste or some measure might be the reason it has low turnout. We want to make sure we observe where error is and improve in its market approach. We can make sure Ches is the supply lead of this product in Canada since it dominated ahead of our other product. We can supply and run low cost in Canada to gain more ground.
•	We can decide to make our Headquarter in Australia with major in supply of 50% Dark Bites, since it dominated the largest share of our revenue. We want to ensure we stay closer to our client giving them stress free moment in accessing our products.
•	We want to make sure we transfer all the sales person in the region of New Zealand and make them pair with the top ten sales persons and we want to make sure the best sales person is transferred to this region to study actively the loopholes of the low revenue generated. Since we know the people are interested in Mint Chop Choco, we want to make sure we take some measures to make its market more trending and delivery consistency. We can win more customers with this measure.
•	We should look back into the performance analysis of January being the best and the month we recorded the highest revenue. UK was the region we performed best at January; we want to ensure the salesperson who made sale to UK in January are called to table to juxtapose on what measures were taken then. We can also ensure we improve the production of Organic Choc Syrup sine it performed best with highest number of counts. We should take precaution measures to implement on forthcoming months.
•	April is the least revenue generated month so far. We should look into month of April operations and all peculiar measures taken. We could deduce that the price range of product bought most were 7-2006, probably there was economic issues or peoples thought about buying. We should do our feasibility study to figure out why there was a low revenue in the month of April.
